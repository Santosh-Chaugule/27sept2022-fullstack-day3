    <p>
      In relationships or otherwise, getting bombarded with questions which you
      may not be comfortable answering to, can get on the nerves, while staying
      out of such situations or saying that it is none of their business can
      help, often it may come off as rude. In case we want to maintain a stable
      relationship with the people, all the while setting a boundary on the
      personal space, here are a few tips which may come handy in such
      situations. Addressing the same, Psychotherapist Emily H Sanders wrote,
      “It can be tough to know how to respond to prying questions from
      over-involved family members, gossipy coworkers, or prying neighbors.
      While you’re welcome to whip out none of your business, here are a few
      ways to consider responding to questions that make you uncomfortable. Take
      what works for you, use your own wording, or build off of them.”
