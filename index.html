      Self-witnessing: Paying attention to yourself and watching yourself from a
      third-person perspective can be a good way to know about the character
      that you hold. Witness yourself with curiosity and watch yourself navigate
      through life. Only then it gets easier to make changes. Company: The
      company that surrounds us also impact our lives hugely. Be with people who
      are compassionate, supportive and understanding. It is important to be
      with positive people in order to stay positive in life.
